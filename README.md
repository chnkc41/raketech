### UX Improvements

- For mobile design, team names can be hidden and their shortcuts can be shown. In this way, it will have more places and the display of the football scoreboard will be good. The football scoreboard is scrollable.

Not: Since there is no team players field in the API, a static definition was made for the "tooltip" example.
